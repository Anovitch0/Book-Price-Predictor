======

This Streamlit application provides an interactive interface for exploring
the synthetic books dataset and predicting book prices based on user
input. It loads a preâ€‘trained machine learning model (trained in
``train_model.py``) and uses it to generate price estimates from
features such as category, rating, availability, and description
length.

Key features:

* **Dataset explorer** â€“ View the first few rows of the dataset.
* **Price distribution** â€“ Inspect average prices by category via a bar chart.
* **Price predictor** â€“ Input your own book metadata and obtain an
  estimated price.
* **About** â€“ Learn more about the project and its synthetic nature.

To run the app locally, navigate to the ``data_science_project``
directory and execute:

    streamlit run app/app.py

Note: ``streamlit`` must be installed in your Python environment. If you
encounter an import error, install the package with ``pip install
streamlit``.
